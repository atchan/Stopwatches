Two web-based stopwatches: one counting up and the other counting down.  

Features include:

An input field: user can specify how many seconds to count up to/down from. 
Two read-only stopwatch displays: one counts up from 0 to input, and the other counts down from input to 0.
Two sets of stopwatch controls: start/pause button and reset button (one for each stopwatch).
Stopwatch displays: days, hours, minutes, and seconds (i.e. "2 days 3 hours 15 minutes 12 seconds").
When a stopwatch reaches its goal, counting stops and button controls become disabled.
